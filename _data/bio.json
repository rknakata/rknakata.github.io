As a worker, I stived to send out each order in a timely and neat manner while prepping and cleaning the work-space enviroment. As a kitchen team member you are not only expected to make the orders, but also wash and clean kitchen utensils, sweep, mop, and squeegee the floors. At Curry House, we upkeep our kitchen and maintain a zero transparency work ethic. High emphasis is placed on up-keeping the cleanliness of the kitchen. Working as a cook at one of the best Japanese restaurants has taught me how to deal witha  substantial workload in an orderly manner.",
