A common interview question is “What are design patterns?”, followed by “What design patterns have you used in your own code?”

For this technical essay, you will write an interesting and informative technical essay that ends up answering these two questions. By doing so, you’ll be better prepared to answer this question if it comes up in an interview.

Do not, under any circumstances, write two paragraphs, one with the title “What are design patterns?” and one with the title “How I have used them in my code.” That will get you no points, as such an essay would be too boring for anyone to read.

Instead, write an essay, perhaps using metaphor or analogy, which by its conclusion has answered these two questions but in a clever, interesting, and informative fashion.


What are design patterns? How can an employee design code in a simple way that is functional? Over the years programmers have begun using the methods when organizing and writing code. As time went on patterns started to become more prevalent in peoples code and design patterns were set.

Using design patterns help programmers implement code that is easy to understand while following a format that allow other programmers to contribute to the same code.
