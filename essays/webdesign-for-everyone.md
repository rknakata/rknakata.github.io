Web design for everyone

Over the past two weeks my software engineering class has been focusing on website design and UI. We started off with the bare basics by writing our own CSS stylesheets for the first week. As I was going through the routine I found myself googling alot of the examples and just referencing previous assignments having to constantly switch between my IDE and chrome just to look at past examples. In the end the pages were bleak and left something to be desired. The next week we were introduced to Semmantic UI a UI framework that aims to make UI design implementation syntax "semmantic", hence the name. Semmantic takes a difference approach to web design when compared to other UI frameworks. When implementing semmantic you are referencing semmantics .css file's classes. The naming convention of these classes makes adding them to your could semmanticaly logical. For instance if I wanted to add a blue facebook icon I would create an i tag with a class of "ui blue facebook icon". Using semmantic my webpages started to look more clean and I found myself saving time by adding semmantics style classes to my markup. In our concluding project for this section we were tasked with copying a website and implementing it using Semmantic UI. I added the pictures of my pages below for your comparison.
