Practice makes perfect?

Last week for my software engineering class we were introduced to the IDE IntelliJ in conjunction with ESlint a code linter. Using an IDE felt different in the sense that I would have code errors pointed out for me. My previous semester we used the console to compile our programs for ICS 212. I thought it would be great that I finally got to switch back to the IDE but I was wrong. ESlint to my surprise not only spots errors but it also forces you to follow strict coding standards that don't effect functionality but the looks of the code. At first I found myself pulling my hair out everytime I saw the red X meaning that there was an ESlint error. After a while I became more aware of these coding standards and started doing it by themself. Simple things such as ending a file with a newlint to putting a space before "{}"s. I feel in the end using ESlint will make me a better coder because practice makes perfect. I am glad my professor is making me use this tool while I am still new to IDEs because I feel I am more impressionable now than I will ever be and I want to get in the proper practice.

Smart Question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48270127/can-a-1-a-2-a-3-ever-evaluate-to-true">link</a>
This question was the top trending question on stack overflow with over 300k views at the time. It is titled "Can (a ==1 && a== 2 && a==3) ever evaluate to true?". This title drew me in because the obvious answer would seem to be no but the way the author presented it as an interview question made the reader want to solve the problem for a sense of accomplishment.

Bad Question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39144526/how-to-declare-a-multidimensional-array-variable-with-two-or-more-single-array-i">link</a>
I had originally found another bad question that was taken down by the user due to a person complaining that it was off topic, which led me to another bad question by the same author. In his question he asks a yes or no question which if answered literally would not solve his problem. In his sample code he added the following comment "//Is it possible? Give me a solution for this situation:". In his comment he asks yet another question simply demanding a solution. One of the comments read, "You should have just tried to compile it and read the errors..." which was kind of rude. A correct solution was posted explaining what the author did wrong and giving the correct code. The author did not mark the commenter's post as an answer. Overall, I feel the author was lazy and did not give the person who answered his question any respect. If I was a person going through stack overflow, I would not want to help this person.
